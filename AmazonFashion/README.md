# AmazonFashion

Downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/amazoncom-fashion-products, The dataset has 10000 products listings from Amazon UK created by PromptCloud's in-house web-crawling service. I used the free dataset as original data source, and programmed some functions to help current or potential sellers on Amazon UK.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install AmazonFashion
```

## Usage

Core Functions are as follow:  
1. A list of Unique Values for selected column (a reference for further analysis)  
2. by Category: What's the average review rating and price?   
3. by Category: What's the top N highest review products?    
4. by Category: What's the price distribution look like? Also some data visualization.    
5. by Manufacturer: What products are each of them selling?  
6. Export the CSV files after Text Cleaning.
