# AmazonFashion  

## Introduction 
The project used a dataset of fashion products crawled from Amazon UK by PromptCloud's in-house web-crawling service. I generated some functions for front-end users to have an interactive way with product analytics and management. Main audience are current and potential sellers focusing on fashion products on Amazon UK. 

## Package 
The package was also published in test pypi, you can view it here: https://test.pypi.org/project/amazonfashion/.   


## How to find the files?
Please see the AmazonFashion folder, and you can find the code in /src/AmazonFashion/AmazonFashion.py. The dataset is in the same folder named amazon_co-ecommerce_sample.csv. The README file in the package folder provide a more detailed explanation on functions. See demonstration of the package in Demo_AmazonFashion.ipynb.
